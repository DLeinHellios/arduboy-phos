## Description
Phos is a simple space shooter for the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/) game system. You are the pilot of Phos, the last line of defense against the invading generic alien army. Utilize your only weapon in a futile attempt to outlast the barrage. Points reward your efforts, but they only serve to antagonize our alien overlords. You won't make it out alive, but the points seem to help a little.
